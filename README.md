## 📋 Project Overview

**Domain:** Digital Marketplace Services (non-retail)

The **Service Quality, Rating & Dispute Management System** is a secure, intermediate platform designed to eliminate financial risk and operational friction in the gig economy. By integrating an **automated escrow vault** with a human-in-the-loop **arbitration layer**, the system bridges the trust gap between Customers and Service Providers.

Unlike traditional booking platforms that leave users vulnerable to fraud or substandard work, our system acts as a neutral guardian of the transaction. It ensures that funds are protected, identities are verified, and conflicts are resolved objectively using immutable evidence.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In current service marketplaces, trust is a significant barrier to adoption. Customers hesitate to pay upfront due to fear of low-quality work, while Service Providers face risks of non-payment or unjustified chargebacks. Existing platforms lack a transparent, evidence-based mechanism to handle these conflicts, often resulting in:
* Financial loss for one or both parties.
* Arbitrary dispute resolutions without proper evidence.
* A deterioration of platform trust and user retention.

## 🛡️ Core Solution Architecture

Our solution enforces fairness through three non-negotiable mechanisms:

1.  **Escrow-First Payments:** Funds are secured in a holding vault immediately upon booking. They are not released to the Provider until the Customer confirms satisfactory delivery, nor can they be withdrawn by the Customer without cause.
2.  **Mandatory Identity Verification (KYC):** All Service Providers undergo strict identity verification to prevent anonymous fraud and ensure accountability.
3.  **Evidence-Based Arbitration:** In the event of a dispute, a neutral Arbitrator reviews a complete audit trail—including chat logs, shared media, and contract terms—to issue a binding verdict.
