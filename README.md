## Problem: Service Quality, Rating & Dispute Management System

**Domain:** Service Quality & Dispute Management

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Service marketplaces currently lack a transparent, evidence-based mechanism to handle conflicts, resulting in financial loss and mistrust between Customers and Service Providers when service standards are not met.

## 📖 Description
The **Service Quality & Dispute Management System** is a secure intermediary platform designed to bridge the trust gap between Customers and Service Providers.

Unlike standard booking applications, our system acts as a neutral guardian of the transaction. It ensures fairness through three key mechanisms:
1.  **Escrow Payments:** Funds are secured in a holding vault upon booking and are only released when the service is successfully delivered.
2.  **Identity Verification:** All service providers undergo mandatory ID verification to ensure accountability.
3.  **Arbitration Layer:** In the event of a disagreement, a neutral third-party Arbitrator reviews non-repudiable evidence (chat logs, photos, and contracts) to issue a binding ruling, ensuring a fair outcome for both parties.

This system creates a safer environment where quality is incentivized, and disputes are resolved objectively.
